This is the OpenWrt feed for phantap

As we require some non default kernel settings, you must rebuild OpenWrt from scratch to use it

**Note** Your username and computer name used for building will be visible on the device.

Once OpenWrt is built and installed, you just need to configure
phantap bridge. Assuming eth0 and eth1 are not used:
```
uci set network.phantap.ifname='eth0 eth1'
uci commit network
/etc/init.d/network reload
```
