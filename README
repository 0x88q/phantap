This is the OpenWrt feed for phantap

As we require some non default kernel settings, you must rebuild OpenWrt from scratch to use it

**Note** Your username and computer name used for building will be visible on the device.

Once OpenWrt is built and installed, you just need to configure
phantap bridge.

* Get the interface names from the device

```
ip a
```

* If the interfaces are part of a bridge already, remove them from the bridge
* Add the interfaces to the phantap bridge via the following commands in the cli
(assuming eth0 and eth1 are used):

```
uci set network.phantap.ifname='eth0 eth1'
uci commit network
/etc/init.d/network reload
```
